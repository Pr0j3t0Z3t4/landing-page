# Landing Page - The Odin Project

This is a capstone project for the Foundations module of **The Odin Project**. The goal was to recreate an entire landing page based on a provided design, using pure HTML and CSS.

## 1.0 Technologies Used
 
* **1.1 HTML5**: Semantic structure.
* **1.2 CSS3**: Styling and Layout.
* **1.3 Flexbox**: Used extensively to align items (Header, Cards, CTA, Footer).

## 2.0 What I learned

During this project, I practiced fundamental web development concepts:

* 2.1 **Flexbox Layout**: How to use `justify-content` (space-between, center) and `align-items` to position elements.
* 2.2 **Box Model**: Fine-tuning `padding`, `margin`, and borders.
* 2.3 **Alignment**: How to center containers and limit width (`max-width`) so the site doesn't stretch too much on large screens.
* 2.4 **Text Styling**: Importing fonts and using different weights (Light/Bold).

## * How to view the project

1.  Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/SEU-USUARIO/landing-page.git](https://github.com/SEU-USUARIO/landing-page.git)
    ```
2.  Open the `index.html` file in your browser.
